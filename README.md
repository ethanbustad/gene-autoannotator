# Gene Autoannotator

## Introduction / Purpose

An application that uses LLMs to summarize published literature on supplied genes into specified fields, in order to automate the curation of gene annotations.

## High Level Overview:

1. Input: Gene identifier (locus or name).
2. Paper Retrieval: Query PubMed Central to obtain relevant research articles.
3. Section Extraction: Extract the abstract, results, and discussion sections from each paper.
4. Initial LLM Summarization: Submit each section to multiple large language models (`mistral-nemo:12b`, `llama3:8b`, `gemma3:12b`) to generate independent summaries.
5. Consensus Generation: Reconcile the outputs from the three LLMs using a tiebreaker model (`phi4:14b`) to produce a unified section summary.
6. Gene-Level Aggregation: Combine the consensus summaries across all papers using `gemma3:12b` to generate a final, aggregated gene annotation.
7. Output: Structured gene annotation for the input gene.
